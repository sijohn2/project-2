<h3>ABOUT THE FOUNDER</h3>
<p>To get a sense of Melissa McMillan’s no-shortcuts attitude, just sink  your teeth into her signature Montreal-style pastrami sandwich, which  she serves at her two eateries in Oregon. In 2013, she opened Sammich in Ashland, her first brick-and-mortar restaurant; three years later, her Pastrami Zombie  food truck launched in Portland to rave reviews. Now the Sammich Queen  has opened her third location, Sammich PDX in December of 2017. Each  locally sourced ingredient tells a different part of McMillan’s story.  She traces her obsession with homemade meats back to her childhood in  Texas, the heart of barbecue country. It’s why she roasts, smokes, and  cures it all in-house. Everything else she puts between two slices of  bread comes from an obsession with no-gimmicks Chicago delis, something  she missed when she left the Windy City. With a religious fervor for  baseball, she borrows her motto from her favorite team, the Chicago  Cubs: “Do simple better.” That ethos has earned her ink in national  publications such as The New York Times and Sunset Magazine. She even  landed on Portland Monthly’s list of top women business owners. But  McMillan finds the most satisfaction when she hangs out with her four  brothers, coaches baseball in her community and peers through her  food-truck window at happy customers trying to smile as they stuff their  faces with kick-ass sandwiches.
